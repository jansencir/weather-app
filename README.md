# Weather App
Visual Crossing API-based Weather App.

## Description
Create a weather app using the Visual Crossing API. Goal of the project is to play around with API's.

## Features
### Weather Matching Color
The color of the container will change color depending on the weather condition. I thought it would be cool to have a visual of how the weather is going to look (and I wanted to play with color schemes).

### 6-Hour Projection
Shows a general overview of the upcoming weather for the next 6 hours. Only shows the time, temperature, and the weather conditions.

## Note
The time at the top doesn't show the current time, it shows the time that the most recent weather report was made.

Also, I still need to add media queries.
